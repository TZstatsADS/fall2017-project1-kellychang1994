### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ This project is conducted by Yi Zhang

+ Project summary: Every four years people witness the U.S. presidential inauguration. It always leads to wide discussion since the speeches are related to what the president would put emphasis in four years. Thus, exploring the speeches of all the U.S. presidents is becoming a popular topic. Using basic text mining and nlp process, I get some results shown as below.
